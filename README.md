### Team Members 

  - Harika Malempati
  - Meghana Thakkellapati

### Project Summary

  - We will be using Walmart Store transactions as our data set
  - We are working on total weekly sales for a Store, based on whether it is working day or holiday

#### Describe your data source
Our data source is train.txt, which is structured data. It contains 5 fields named Store, Dept, Date, Weekly_Sales and IsHoliday. It is of size 12.2MB.

##### Link to your original data source:

#### What makes it a big data problem? (Use the Vs of Big Data)
Volume:  Volume of the data set is 12.2 MB. There are 4,21,570 records.
Variety:  It is a structured data. Data is stored in text file
Velocity:  This is historical training data that covers to 2010-02-05 to 2012-11-01
Veracity:  Data is formatted/cleaned and it is trustworthy
Value:  The weekly sales for holidays week is much higher than non-holidays week

#### Map Reduce problems in the format "for each _(key)_ , we will find the _(value)__".
```sh
$ For each store, calculate the total weekly sales for a store, during Non-holiday week
$ For each store, calculate the total weekly sales for a store, during holiday week
```

#### Mapper input:  show one line of data that your mapper will read.
```sh
 45  98  9/7/2012  352.44  TRUE 
```

#### Language:
We used Python for Map Reduce coding

##### Process:  Will your processing be numeric, or will you need text processing and/or cleaning?
Our Processing is numeric. We will be calculating the total sales for a store during holidays and Non-holidays. We donâ€™t need any data cleaning.

##### Steps to Execute Mapper and Reducer code:
  - Connect to the virtual machine and go to the hadoop.
  - Open terminal and direct to folder udacity_training.
  - Under udacity_training go to code folder and create mapper.py.
  - This file reads the lines from train.txt which is placed in myinput directory of hadoop.
  - This file outputs store as key and its corresponding sales as its value and passes it to reducer2.py
  - Create reducer2.py file which reads the lines from mapper.py file 
  - It sums up the sales of each store during the holiday and non holiday periods in the above two mapper-reducer jobs created by us.
  - Type the following command to run the map-reduce jobs through hadoop. hs mapper.py reducer2.py myinput projectoutput
  - The output of reducer2 is directed to projectoutput/part-00000
  - To check the output, type the following command hadoop fs -cat projectoutput/part-00000 | less
  - Copy the output from the command prompt and emailed it our emailid's.
